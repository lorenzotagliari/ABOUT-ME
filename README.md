-----Description-----------------------

This repository was created to share my data science projects with the community at large, particularly recruiters for Data Science jobs.
Here, you'll find Python code written in Jupyter Notebook, encompassing data analysis and machine learning models. 
Additionally, there are also PostgreSQL scripts. New projects and materials will be regularly added over time.

------About me-------------------------

My name is Lorenzo Rühling Tagliari, and I hold a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
I am Italo-Brazilian and moved to Italy last year, where I have been living since.
Over the past year, I decided to transition my career to Data Science and Analysis, a field I have been passionate about even before completing my degree a few years ago.
Programming has always fascinated me since my first encounter with a programming language at the beginning of my Bachelor's degree.
Recently, I have been leveraging my background in the scientific field and applying it to data science and statistical analysis projects

Each project directory contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that can be executed to replicate the analyses and models.
